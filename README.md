# Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my Python projects repository. This repository contains two comprehensive case studies focused on real-world data analysis and machine learning:

1. Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations
2. Analyzing Google Merchandise Store Data

## Case Study 1: Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a hotel booking will be canceled. The dataset used for this case study includes booking data from a resort hotel and a city hotel, covering over 119,000 observations with 32 variables. Key steps in the project include:

Data Exploration: Understanding the distribution and relationships of various features.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features and preparing the data for modeling.

Modeling: Building a predictive model using a Random Forest classifier to predict cancellations.

The dataset and analysis provide valuable insights into factors influencing hotel booking cancellations, helping hotels optimize their booking and revenue management strategies.

## Case Study 2: Analyzing Google Merchandise Store Data

This project explores session data from the Google Merchandise Store for a single day (August 1, 2017), analyzing the traffic sources, user behavior, and sales performance. The analysis leverages both SQL and Python, focusing on:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the key metrics that drive sales and user engagement on the eCommerce platform.

Insights Extraction: Identifying trends and patterns that can inform marketing and sales strategies.

This analysis demonstrates how data can be used to optimize online store performance by understanding customer behavior.
